Every page has:

1 primary CTA: Get the Free Packet

1 contextual CTA: “Want the grocery list for this?” / “Want the 30-day calendar?” → same form, different tag

“No backend” 30-day challenge (how it works)

You can still make it feel interactive without accounts:

Option A (best): 30-day email sequence

User enters email → receives packet immediately

Optional checkbox: “Start the 30-Day Challenge emails”

Daily email for 30 days, each includes:

Today’s checklist (3 Fuels + 3 Rules)

Meal idea (supports Fuel 1)

Snack guidance (Fuel 2)

Protein dessert idea (Fuel 3)

“No caloric drinks” reminder (Rule 1)

“Weigh-in reminder” (Rule 2)

30-second mindset tip (Rule 3: repeat)

Option B: Web checklist using local storage

A “Day 1–Day 30” checklist on the site

Progress saved in the browser (localStorage) — no accounts

“Download the printable tracker” as backup

You can do both. Email is the retention engine.
